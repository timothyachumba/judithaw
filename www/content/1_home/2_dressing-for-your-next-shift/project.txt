Intro: <p>The editorial concept was derived from the values presented in the accompanying article, which discussed the dress code rules of modern day work places such as co-working spaces. The article claimed that a modern day workplace dress code has to meet the following values: comfort, convenience, creativity/uniqueness as well as belonging/acceptance.Â </p><p>Comfort and convenience were shown through a combination of set design and posturing by showing the models lounging on office chairs in a manner that would be quite inappropriate in a traditional workplace setting. To show creativity/uniqueness as well as belonging/acceptance, inspiration was taken from editorials from the 60s, which picture almost identical looking models in uniform-like clothing. By showing a modern twist on traditional workwear, the styling was integral to telling the story.</p>
