Intro: <p>The editorial was developed to accompany an article discussing the short lived effects of newness on our levels of dopamine. To symbolise the practice of preserving an items newness even at the cost of its functionality or aesthetic value, the editorial taps into and exaggerates measures taken by fashion professionals during photo shoots to preserve the newness of the items used on set. This was deemed appropriate as the articles main audience is fashion professionals familiar with such practices.</p>
